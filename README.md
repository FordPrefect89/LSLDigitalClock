# LSLDigitalClock
Script for a digital clock using the Linden Scripting Language

This is a simple script using textures I purchased in world.

Two man tasks need to still be done.  They are as follows:
# TODO:
Create menu to be able to select 12/24 clock.
Create menu to select time zone.  Currently set for Pacific Time or SL Time
